# Jumping-Jackpot
Arduino game based on popular jumping rope arcade games.


*This game is purely just for fun, and using Arduino and Ada-fruit. Attempts to mimic the jump rope games in many arcades, using the Adafruit Circuit Playground.*
* Currently no updates planned.

The jump rope will move counter-clockwise, and you must click the right button and hold it once it is at the 10th light. There's no time limit, but if you press the button at the wrong pixel its game over. The game continues for 5 levels, and each level gets faster if you win.
