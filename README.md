# Jumping-Jackpot
Arduino game based on popular jumping rope arcade games.

*This game is purely just for fun, and I was primarily goofing off with Arduino and Ada-fruit. I thought it would be fun to mimic the demonic jump rope game in many arcades, using the Adafruit Circuit Playground*

The jump rope will move counter-clockwise, and you must click the right button and hold it once it is at the 10th light. You can wait for as long as you want to do it, however if you press the button at the wrong pixel its game over. The game continues for 5 levels, and each level gets faster if you win. 

When the game starts a cute sound + animation will occur, then the game begins. When the light is going through the cycle, the games theme plays. When you get the correct pixel, a level up sound plays and the game continues. If you miss, then a bad sound plays with red lights. If you win you get a cute victory theme + animation.
